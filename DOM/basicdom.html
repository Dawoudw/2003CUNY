    <!-- DOM Document Object Model
    tree diagram of the relationships between you html elements
    
    JS was initially created to be able to edit the DOM
    This makes webpages dynamic
    i.e. you perform some sort of action and the web page is altered-->

<body>
    <h1 id="greeting" style="color: aquamarine;">Hello Everyone!!!</h1>
    <button onclick="toSpanish()">Spanish</button>
    <button id="frenchButton">French</button>
</body>

<script>

    let frbtn = document.getElementById("frenchButton");
    // event handler        event, handler function
    // event is what you are listening for 
    //the handler function is what to do when that happens
    // saying what function to run not actually running that function
    frbtn.addEventListener("click",toFrench);


    // functions that maniuplate the dom tend to not return anything
    // they just DO something
    // JS is a scripting language it tells the browser what to do
    // You can run chunks of it at a time
    function toSpanish(){
        let greet = document.getElementById("greeting") // returns an element object;
        greet.style = "color: blue";
        greet.innerHTML = "Hola Todos";
    }

    function toFrench(){
        let greet = document.getElementById("greeting");
        greet.style = "color: red";
        greet.innerHTML = "Bonjour toutes les personnes";
